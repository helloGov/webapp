    # mount the host directory e2e/cypress and the file e2e/cypress.json as
    # volumes within the container
    # this means that:
    #  1. anything that Cypress writes to these folders (e.g., screenshots,
    #     videos) appears also on the Docker host's filesystem
    #  2. any change that the developer applies to Cypress files on the host
    #     machine immediately takes effect within the e2e container (no docker
    #     rebuild required).

      - ./e2e/cypress:/app/cypress
      - ./e2e/cypress.json:/app/cypress.json
